# Learn_GradleJavaProjectIntellij
Goal: learn to start a java project and learn to use Gradle for building and testing the project.  Of course, this is done through Intellij, so I can learn to incoporate all of this into the Intellij IDE.

Mainly learn how to construct and control the grandle.build file.  The Java program is trival and meaningless.
Its goal is to construct core packages and supporting packages, and unit test packages.
TODO: add project-wide integration test package.
